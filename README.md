![YouCanFly Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150/0000FF/FFFFFF?text=YouCanFly)

## Welcome to YouCanFly!
Ever dreamt of soaring through the skies, feeling the wind in your hair, and marveling at the world from above? 
With YouCanFly, your dreams aren't just dreams anymore - they're your next weekend project! 
Yes, you heard it right, even YOU can build your very own flying machine with materials you probably have lying around your house and garage.

## Quick Start Guide

Let's get you off the ground (literally) in no time! For those who prefer the express route, we've got you covered with our one-shot install script. For the DIY enthusiasts, we've detailed instructions to make your flying dreams come true.

### One-Shot Install (For the impatient flyers)

Just run the following command in your terminal, sit back, and watch the magic happen:

```sh
curl -sSL https://you-can-fly.nowhere/install | sh
```

DIY Installation (For the hands-on builders)
If you're more of a do-it-yourselfer, follow these easy steps to assemble your flying machine:

1.  Gather Materials
◦ 4 car tires (for landing gear, obviously)
◦ 2 large umbrellas (for wings, because aerodynamics)
◦ 1 kitchen chair (pilot's seat)
◦ Duct tape (lots of it)
◦ An old laptop (for navigation)
2.  Construct Your Airframe
◦ Attach the car tires to the bottom of the kitchen chair using duct tape.
◦ Secure the umbrellas to the sides of the chair, open them up, and voila, you've got wings!
3.  Install Navigation System
◦ 
Tape the laptop to the chair's backrest.
◦ 
Download and install our revolutionary navigation software:
pip install you-can-fly-navigation
Or if you're feeling adventurous:
git clone https://github.com/you-can-fly/nav-system.git
cd nav-system
./install.sh
4.  Takeoff
◦ Find a hill or a tall building.
◦ Get a running start.
◦ Jump!

Congratulations! You're now a certified DIY aviator.

## Testimonials
"I never thought flying could be so easy! After my third attempt, I only had a minor concussion. Can't wait to try again after I'm out of the hospital!" - Eager Eddie
"The feeling of freedom was incredible! Until I crash-landed in my neighbor's pool. But hey, incremental progress, right?" - Amelia Airheart II
"Who needs commercial airlines when you've got YouCanFly? Although, I do miss my left shoe... somewhere over the Atlantic, I presume." - High-Flying Harry

## Production Deployments
While YouCanFly is an exhilarating project for the DIY enthusiast, we must acknowledge that when it comes to real-world scenarios, especially those involving long distances, complex weather conditions, or simply the desire to arrive in one piece, it is advisable to 
opt for a commercial carrier.

Flying is indeed a science and a highly specialized activity. 
The testimonials above, while filled with the spirit of adventure, do highlight the potential for, well, let's call them "unexpected outcomes." 
In the interest of safety, and to avoid the kind of catastrophes humorously recounted by our users, we recommend leaving the flying to the experts.

For all your real-world flying needs, buying an airline ticket is not only the safest option but also the most reliable way to ensure you reach your destination. Remember, incremental progress in DIY aviation is thrilling, but arriving safely is truly priceless.

## Conclusion
YouCanFly is a tribute to the spirit of innovation, the joy of creation, and the undying human desire to conquer the skies. 
While our project may not get you from New York to Paris, it will definitely get you from your garage to possibly the next block over (weather and duct tape permitting).
Happy flying, and remember: when in doubt, there's always commercial!
 
## Disclaimer: YouCanFly is a parody project. Please do not attempt to build or fly any aircraft based on the instructions provided. Always prioritize safety and leave flying to trained professionals and certified aircraft. Enjoy the humor, but keep your feet on the ground.


## Why?
* Because There is just too many  well-meaning-but-backed-by-commercial open source online that makes it look like anyone and everyone with a latptop and command line can do literally anything and everything.
* Because there is this obsession with "incremental improvement", MVP and showing value fast, dman fast man!
* Because  some things, well, they can just not be built or made that way!

A systemic problem in today's knowledge economy is when smart, curious and motivated scientists and engineers get beguiled by open source projects that are backed by financial SaaS products.
The open source projects have flashy and well-written READMEs  and other documentation, and supporting blog articles that makes it look like a piece of cake to use the project and to achieve true value.
The especially easy-to-follow getting started instructions routinely obfuscate the true complexity involved in choosing the project as part of a overall solution and the true effort required to deliver lasting value.
The relative ease and speed at which meager results can be achieved with further spurs the professionals on to push forward and ignore many one-way decisions that the particular technology choice might impose.
The meager results are often enough for the professionals to show so called incremental value to superiors that are easily impressed by flashy demos.
The overwhelming sense of accomplishment that the professionals experience adds to the obsession with these quick to get going type of projects.
The plafora of happy and positive testimonials by happy users further fuels the cargo cult like obsessions.

Given this context, I would like to parody a fake such project. The project is called YouCanFly and we want to produce a README and some additional documentation.
The overall tone of the documentation must be highly engaging and fun. It should appeal to an age group representing young professionals with 5 or so years of industry experience.
The overall idea of the parody project is that the project claims, and shows you how "you, yes even you also" can easily build a flying device and fly useful distances.
The README should go into easy-to-follow instructions that only requires common house hold and automotive materials.
The quick getting started section should offer bogus pip install and other instructions, for Windows, Linux and Mac, in the event that you do not have some critical part at hand.
The quick getting started section should have a fake one-shot install script, and then a longer do-it-yourself section with the bogus CLI commands, reference to other fake projects for providing critical components required to build a "flying machine" also known as an airplane.

The docs should include testimonials by happy users who built and operated their flying machines, all with some catastrophy as a result, but all praising the project and putting the blame of failure on their own misunderstanding or attributing it to being part of future improvements (that future improvements will overcome this and that we must remember we are showing incremental progress).
The README should have near the end, a section on production deployments, which reveals the truth in a sardonic  manner, stating that for real-world scenarios, this project is great but not sufficient, and the user should buy an airline ticket and choose a commercial carrier for all their flying needs.
The production deployment section should come clean that flying is a science and highly specialised activity, and that for safety concerns and to avoid what most of the testimonials speak of (catastrophy) it is advisable to leave it to the experts and buy rather than build.
