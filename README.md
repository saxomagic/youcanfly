DIY Installation (For the hands-on builders)
If you're more of a do-it-yourselfer, follow these easy steps to assemble your flying machine:

1.  Gather Materials
◦ 4 car tires (for landing gear, obviously)
◦ 2 large umbrellas (for wings, because aerodynamics)
◦ 1 kitchen chair (pilot's seat)
◦ Duct tape (lots of it)
◦ An old laptop (for navigation)
2.  Construct Your Airframe
◦ Attach the car tires to the bottom of the kitchen chair using duct tape.
◦ Secure the umbrellas to the sides of the chair, open them up, and voila, you've got wings!
3.  Install Navigation System
◦ 
Tape the laptop to the chair's backrest.
◦ 
Download and install our revolutionary navigation software:
pip install you-can-fly-navigation
Or if you're feeling adventurous:
git clone https://github.com/you-can-fly/nav-system.git
cd nav-system
./install.sh
4.  Takeoff
◦ Find a hill or a tall building.
◦ Get a running start.
◦ Jump!

## Testimonials
"I never thought flying could be so easy! After my third attempt, I only had a minor concussion. Can't wait to try again after I'm out of the hospital!" - Eager Eddie
"The feeling of freedom was incredible! Until I crash-landed in my neighbor's pool. But hey, incremental progress, right?" - Amelia Airheart II
"Who needs commercial airlines when you've got YouCanFly? Although, I do miss my left shoe... somewhere over the Atlantic, I presume." - High-Flying Harry

## Production Deployments
While YouCanFly is an exhilarating project for the DIY enthusiast, we must acknowledge that when it comes to real-world scenarios, especially those involving long distances, complex weather conditions, or simply the desire to arrive in one piece, it is advisable to 
opt for a commercial carrier.

Flying is indeed a science and a highly specialized activity. 
The testimonials above, while filled with the spirit of adventure, do highlight the potential for, well, let's call them "unexpected outcomes." 
In the interest of safety, and to avoid the kind of catastrophes humorously recounted by our users, we recommend leaving the flying to the experts.

For all your real-world flying needs, buying an airline ticket is not only the safest option but also the most reliable way to ensure you reach your destination. Remember, incremental progress in DIY aviation is thrilling, but arriving safely is truly priceless.

## Conclusion
YouCanFly is a tribute to the spirit of innovation, the joy of creation, and the undying human desire to conquer the skies. 
While our project may not get you from New York to Paris, it will definitely get you from your garage to possibly the next block over (weather and duct tape permitting).
Happy flying, and remember: when in doubt, there's always commercial!
 
## Disclaimer: YouCanFly is a parody project. Please do not attempt to build or fly any aircraft based on the instructions provided. Always prioritize safety and leave flying to trained professionals and certified aircraft. Enjoy the humor, but keep your feet on the ground.


## Why?
* Because There is just too many  well-meaning-but-backed-by-commercial open source online that makes it look like anyone and everyone with a latptop and command line can do literally anything and everything.
* Because there is this obsession with "incremental improvement", MVP and showing value fast, dman fast man!
* Because  some things, well, they can just not be built or made that way!
